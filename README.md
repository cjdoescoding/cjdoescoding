To anyone reading this: hi! My name is CJ, and I'm an aspiring developer who wants to make digital solutions that make everyone's lives just a little bit easier.
I have moderate experience in HTML/CSS with my personal website and am currently in the process of learning Python and Javascript. 
My main interest is in anything that creates in some way, be it game development, novel writing (mostly sci-fi/action), music, and more.

You may contact me thru e-mail (carlosjosecastillo00@gmail.com) or on Discord (cluelessjokester). I ask that you only use these outlets for important matters.
Thank you for taking the time to read this, and that's all.
