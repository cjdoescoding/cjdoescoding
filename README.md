To anyone reading this: hi! My name is <b>C.J.</b>, and I'm an aspiring developer who wants to make digital solutions that make everyone's lives just a little bit easier.
I have moderate experience in <b>HTML/CSS</b> with my personal website and am currently in the process of learning <b>Python</b> and <b>Javascript</b>. 
My main interest is in anything that creates in some way, be it game development, novel writing (mostly sci-fi/action), music, and more.

You may contact me thru e-mail <i>(carlosjosecastillo00@gmail.com)</i> or on Discord <i>(cluelessjokester)</i>. I ask that you only use these outlets for important matters.
Thank you for taking the time to read this, and that's all.
